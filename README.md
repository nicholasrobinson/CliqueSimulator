## Case Notes

### Marketing vs. Sales

* 3% YoY sales increase goal
* 4% YoY gross profit goal
** Achieve by increasing revenue and increasing gross profit margin
** Profit margin was 42% in 2010, now 36% in 2012
* Can monies be shifted from trade discounts [Sales] to Market Development Funds (MDF) [Marketing]?
** Will passing the benefits to consumers outweigh the loss of shelf space?
